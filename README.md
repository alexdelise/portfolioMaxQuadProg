# üí∞ Quadratic Portfolio Optimization Using Gurobi

This project formulates and solves a **constrained portfolio optimization problem** using **Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP)** in Python with **Gurobi**.  
The goal is to construct an optimal portfolio by either:
- **Maximizing expected return** under a risk constraint  
**or**
- **Minimizing portfolio risk** while achieving a minimum expected return

It includes realistic financial constraints:
- **Cardinality limit**
- **Sector exposure limits**
- **Minimum and maximum investment per asset**

## üß© Model Formulation

Please refer to modelDescription.pdf for a full description of the model and its components.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Parameters & Customization

You can easily modify model parameters in `model.py`:

```python
goal = 'maxProfit'            # Choose 'maxProfit' or 'minRisk'
maxCompanies = 20             # Max number of companies in the portfolio
exposureLimit = 0.33          # Max sector exposure
minInvestment = 0.01          # Min investment per selected company
maxInvestment = 0.33          # Max investment per selected company
maxRisk = 0.01                # Risk constraint (only applies to maxProfit objective)
```

## üìä Outputs

After solving, the model will display:

- ‚úÖ **Selected companies and their weights**
- ‚úÖ **Portfolio expected daily return and annualized return**
- ‚úÖ **Portfolio daily and annualized risk (standard deviation)**
- ‚úÖ **Sector exposure breakdown**
- ‚ùóÔ∏è Message if no feasible solution is found

Example Output:

```
Optimal solution found!

Selected Companies & Allocations:
AAPL (Technology): 0.3300
LLY (Healthcare): 0.3300
PWR (Industrials): 0.3300
DECK (Consumer Discretionary): 0.0100

Portfolio Expected Daily Return: 0.0015%
Portfolio Expected Annualized Return: 37.80%
Portfolio Daily Risk (Std Dev): 1.80%
Portfolio Annualized Risk (Std Dev): 28.56%

Sector Exposure:
Technology: 0.3300

## üì• How to Change Company Universe

You can easily change the set of companies and sectors used in the model by modifying and running the `stockInfo.py` script.  
Example snippet:

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

# Define tickers per sector
sectors = {
    'Technology': [...],
    'Healthcare': [...],
    'Financials': [...],
    'Industrials': [...],
    'Consumer Discretionary': [...]
}

# Download data
tickers = [ticker for tickers_in_sector in sectors.values() for ticker in tickers_in_sector]
data = yf.download(tickers, start="2010-01-01", end="2023-12-31", interval="1d")["Adj Close"]
data.to_csv("adjusted_close_prices.csv")

# Save sector mapping
sector_map = {ticker: sector for sector, tickers_in_sector in sectors.items() for ticker in tickers_in_sector}
pd.Series(sector_map, name='Sector').to_csv('sector_mapping.csv')
```
